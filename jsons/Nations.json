		"startIntroPart1": "Hello, Sheeta Laxman. There is 24 years have passed since we were defeated in the war, deployed the Light Sail, and miraculously drifted to this planet. Also it is meaning 24 years since humanity reached Alpha Centauri. Life on Alpha Centauri was not hopeless, as it had a complete ecosystem and was even suitable for breeding. We are beginning to completely dominate nature, just as our ancestors did on Earth in the past.",
		"startIntroPart2": "This is the main report from the envoy, extremely artificial radio waves have been detected by the radio wave measuring equipment. There are rumors at the camp that it's an alien invasion, but it turns out the radio waves are the same as those used in the solar system. If that's true, finally we can go back to our home planet, but their goal will be to take ownership of this planet. We got here before anyone else and are building camp. Shouldn't we assert our vested interests in this alpha frontier? Can you build a colony that stands the test of time?",
